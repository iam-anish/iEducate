        <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">ducation is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
        Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
        takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place
        in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may
        be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.education in zambia </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Many public schools provide a free education through the government. Parents may send their own children to a private
            schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do
            not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or because the
            children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for girls.The city of Alexandria in
            Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the
            great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and
            organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
            society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge,
            values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could
            be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
            Kingdom.</p>
